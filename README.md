## Installation

### System Requirements:
- Python >= 3.11
- PyQt6 library

### Installation Steps:
1. Install Python from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` by running: 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Additional Setup:
1. Install VB-CABLE Virtual Audio Device from the official website: [VB-CABLE Virtual Audio Device](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/).
2. Configure the audio settings on your operating system to use VB-CABLE Virtual Audio Device for listening.

## Usage
1. Open the applications that generate the sound you want to analyze.
2. In the sound settings of each application, select VB-CABLE as the output device.
3. Run the SilentGuardian application: ```python main.py```

## Example Uses
#### 1. Discord Conversations
Enhance your Discord experience by listening to music at a higher volume during quiet moments. SilentGuardian automatically mutes or lowers the volume of your music when someone starts speaking, ensuring you never miss a word.

#### 2. Online Meetings
Improve your productivity during online meetings by applying the same principle. Enjoy background music at a comfortable volume, and let SilentGuardian automatically lower the music volume when someone speaks, allowing you to focus on the conversation without manual adjustments.

#### 3. Watching Movies with Interspersed Music
Enjoy watching movies while occasionally listening to music. SilentGuardian can lower or mute the music when movie audio is detected, providing an uninterrupted viewing experience while still enjoying your favorite tunes.
